-refactor ugly solver code
-make DFS and the other BFS work again (yielding search like GraphSearch)
-precompute known levels solutions
-add pruning back? (compare perfs)
-reduce memory footprint of state objects
-don't upload stats when used solver

-fix bug where solver would not find solutions. (elements at negative indexes)
-stop executing solution moves if change level or reset blocks
-make the UI responsive by regularly giving control back to the UI
-waiting screen
-update waiting screen regularly. Display current status of the search
-stop search when closing waiting screen
